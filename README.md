## University Management System – SQL Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing a **University Management System database** using **SQL queries** to extract meaningful academic insights. The system manages data related to **students, courses, professors, departments, and enrollments**, and uses query-based analysis to support better academic decision-making.

### Key Objectives

* Track **student enrollments and academic performance**
* Identify **high-performing and at-risk students**
* Analyze **course popularity and difficulty levels**
* Evaluate **faculty and department workload**
* Support data-driven academic planning

### Database Tables Used

* Students
* Courses
* Professors
* Departments
* Enrollments
* ProfessorDepartments

### Analysis Performed

* Students with highest course enrollments
* High-grade students eligible for scholarships
* Average grade per student
* Top 5 most enrolled courses
* Courses with low enrollment
* Student workload based on total credits
* Department-wise grade performance
* Identification of difficult courses
* Grade trends over time
* Risk analysis for student failure
* Correlation between course credits and grades

### Key Insights

* Popular courses indicate strong student demand
* Some departments consistently outperform others
* High-credit courses do not guarantee better grades
* SQL-based analysis helps identify students needing academic support

### Technologies Used

* SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, Group By, Filtering)
* Relational Database Design

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **SQL can be used for real-world academic data analysis**, helping universities optimize resources, monitor performance trends, and improve decision-making.
